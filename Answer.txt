-  What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
		a gitignore file is a file that purposeflly ignores certain files as well as file
		extensions that I may not want to include in my own source control, such as someone
		elses file that has a path of theirs in it. In a java project, it should include
		various file extensions such as .jar, .war, and if we're using Eclipse, .project file 
		extensions, and any additonal files that have someone elses path in it. 

-  What does fast-forward in Git mean?
		fast-forward is basically when two branches that differ by one commit, are merged, 		and one of the branches "fast forwards" to catch up to the other branch. 


-  Why should you have different branches?
		Multiple branches allow us to test and commit code in a safe and isolated 		environment, so as not to affect the files within a branch that someone else is 		working. 

-  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
		Usually it is one repository, however you CAN have as many as you'd like. 		Additionally, multiple branches within  one repository are
		also an incredible tool to have. An example of a use for multiple remote git repos 
		would possibly be if you wanted one repository for testing and constant uploading
		while the other could be used for only final drafts of sprints.
